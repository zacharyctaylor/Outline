PROJECT OUTLINE

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
“Task Tracker” is an application designed to help individuals track specific tasks throughout the day. The application is simple and minimal to prevent distractions. You will have the ability to add up to 10 tasks. Once the task is completed you simply delete it or add a check mark.  
PROJECT ADDRESSED
I love social media and surfing the web. I am guilty of falling into the “Tik Tok” hole every time I open my device. Thus, I wanted to create an easily accessible application that will track my tasks without falling into these holes. I also have ADHD and though devices are convenient they are also a struggle. There are many times my wife asks me to help with a chore or fix a household item, in a matter of minutes, 
When tracking tasks people often use the notes application, or the reminders feature on their devices. I find that it can still become distracting or overwhelming since I can see my calendar of reminders and the multitude of notes within the same application. I wanted to create something that is accessed quickly and to the point. Once a task is inputted you simply open the application and can see the task you need to complete.    
PLATFORM
The application will be developed using the latest version of Android (Tiramisu). The
application will be available for both Mobile devices and tablets. The application will be
developed using Android Studio.
FRONT/BACK-END SUPPORT
“Task Tracker” will have full front and back-end support during the development
process. Android Studio and MIT App Inventor will be utilized to test and debug before implementation begins.
FUNCTIONALITY
Upon the completion of the download, the user will have full functionality to start creating a list of tasks. We did not want to create any distractions so the application is only one page. Simply download and you can use it right away.
DESIGN
We wanted a minimal and simplistic design. The top of the application will have the title of the application. There will be a keyboard used to type and add tasks. The tasks added will be populated under the title.
